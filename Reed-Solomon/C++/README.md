# Reed - Solomon

The Reed-Solomon code is a non-binary linear error-correcting code that can correct errors in fixed-size data blocks. It is commonly used in data storage systems, such as hard disks and optical media, and in high-speed data transmission systems, such as satellites and wireless communication systems.

The main advantage of the Reed-Solomon code is that it can correct multiple bit errors in a block of data. This means that even if several bits of data are corrupted, the code can recover the original content. Reed-Solomon can correct up to t errors in a block of n symbols, where t is less than or equal to (n-k)/2, where k is the number of original data symbols.

To implement the Reed-Solomon code in an embedded system, sufficient memory is required to store the original data symbols as well as the parity symbols added by the code. The number of parity symbols added depends on the number of errors that the code should be able to correct. Generally, the number of parity symbols added is equal to 2t, where t is the maximum number of errors the code should be able to correct.

One of the best known applications of the Reed-Solomon code is on compact discs (CDs) and DVDs. The data on a CD or DVD is stored on spiral tracks that are read by a laser. Reed-Solomon code is used to correct errors that can occur due to defects on the disc, dust or scratches on the disc surface. The code is also used in data transmission systems, such as the digital terrestrial television standard (DVB-T), where it is used to correct errors that can occur due to signal interference.

In summary, the Reed-Solomon code is a non-binary linear error-correcting code that is widely used in data storage and high-speed data transmission systems. It can correct multiple bit errors in a block of data and requires sufficient memory to store the original data and the parity symbols added by the code.
